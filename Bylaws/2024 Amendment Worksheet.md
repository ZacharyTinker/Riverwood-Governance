### **Amendment 23: Riverwood’s Mission, Vision & Values**
#### Article #TBD - Vision, Mission, and Values [New Article with Updated #] 
**Proposed:**  
Adding a new article with updated mission, vision, and values statements:  

1. Vision

1.1. Connecting to people and connecting people to Jesus.

1.1.1. Connection reminds us of our connection to God, to one another, and to connect others outside the church to Jesus.

1.1.2. Our heart is to be a place of Connection and to find ways to make Connections outside the church.

1.1.3. The cross is the most powerful connection of Love shown to man. Jesus made that CONNECTION and it transformed the world!

1.1.4. Jesus left us with his Holy Spirit who cries out to bring the Connection of Heaven here on earth through we, His Church.

2. Mission

2.1. To be a Christ-Centered church in Word and Spirit devoted to loving God, one another, and our neighbors like Jesus.

3. Values

3.1. Powerful Prayer and Praise: Prayer is the foundation of any church of Jesus. Prayer follows Jesus' example. It puts the church in God's capable hands (Matt. 6:9-13; Jn 17). Through prayer God moves in ways that are supernatural, changes hearts, and gives guidance and direction. "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man/woman is powerful and effective." (Jas 5:16) Praise and Worship are our prayer to God in song. God inhabits the praises of His people. During Worship we invite God's presence to speak to our hearts, draw us closer to Him, and remind us that He is The Living God.

3.2. Incarnational Living: We let God's Word transform us. What we read we let God work out a growing change in us (Rom. 12:1-2). We want our lives to help others fall in love with Jesus. When they see God's grace, forgiveness, and transformation at work in us they believe God can do that for them too.

3.3. Hospitality: We Welcome strangers like family (God "sets the lonely in families" Ps. 68:6). We enjoy taking care of one another, welcoming others into our homes, and are committed to making room for others with open hearts.

3.4. Generosity: We are extravagant in our love and with the use of our time, talents, and financial gifts (Matt. 25:15; 2 Cor. 9:7). God has shown His generosity time and time again. Jesus gave Himself to serve and love well ("For God so loved the world, He gave..." Jn. 3:16). Jesus gave His life for us. We seek to spend our lives for Him. We believe our generosity will enable us to transform our communities.

3.5. Intentional Discipleship: We want to know more about God so that it will take us further up and further into all He has for us. We do this with a whole-hearted devotion (Mrk 12:30). We are disciples of Jesus, but we make Disciples also. Transgenerational discipleship is Jesus' call to His church (2 Tim. 2:2). We choose to Find a Paul, Become a Barnabus, and train up a Timothy. We organically pursue a mentor, become one to someone else, and become encouragers in our every-day lives.

3.6. God's Global Mission: God calls us to Go, to Pray, and to Give so that other nations will come to know His salvation (Matt. 9:37; Matt. 28:18; 2 Cor. 9:7). We participate in God's mission by being missional where we live, first. We also support missionaries and church planters locally and abroad with prayer and finances so that Christ's mission to "make Disciples of all nations" is advanced beyond us into the world.
