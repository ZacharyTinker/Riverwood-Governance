# Riverwood Church Nomination Committee Guide
## Overview
This guide outlines the process for forming the Nomination Committee, compiling position descriptions, managing nominations, and preparing ballots. It ensures consistency, clarity, and adherence to Riverwoodâ€™s bylaws for future committees. 


## Checklist of Key Actions

### Step 1: Form the Nomination Committee
#### Annual Meeting:
Elect two congregational representatives during the meeting.

#### Post-Annual Meeting Board Meeting:
- Nominate two additional congregational representatives.
- Rank the nominees by board consensus or vote (if required).
- Appoint a board representative (e.g., Secretary, Chair, or Vice Chair) to contact the nominees in ranked order.
- Notify the board of the final two appointees at the next board meeting.
- Formally appoint the two nominees at board meeting.

### Step 2: Identify Positions and Prepare Descriptions
#### First Week of October:
- Convene the Nomination Committee.
- Identify all positions up for election, referencing the bylaws for requirements.
- Draft position descriptions, including:
	- Term length.
	- Responsibilities as outlined in the bylaws (e.g., Deacon chairs the Deacon Committee and serves on the Salary Committee).
- Compile the descriptions into a list for congregational sharing.

### Step 3: Announce Nominations
#### By the Last Sunday in October:
- Announce open positions during the worship service.
- Share the compiled list of positions and descriptions with the congregation.
- Inform members that nominations will be accepted until the last Sunday in November.

#### Nomination Table Setup:

	- A secure drop box for completed slips.
- Monitor the box regularly.

### Step 4: Review and Confirm Nominations
#### By the Last Sunday in November:
- Meet as a committee to:
	- Confirm nominations.
	- Ensure nominees meet eligibility requirements (membership, biblical qualifications, etc.).
	- Address any unfilled positions by brainstorming additional nominees.

#### Nominee Contact:
- Reach out to nominees, asking for a response by the second week of December.
- Notify the committee of responses via email or at the next meeting.

#### Repeat as Necessary:
If positions remain unfilled after the second week of December, reconvene to repeat the nomination process.

### Step 5: Prepare and Share the Nomination Report

- Finalize the Nomination Committee Report.
- Share the report with the congregation
	- during the worship service
	- via email
	- posting the report on the bulletin board.

#### Allow Additional Nominations:
