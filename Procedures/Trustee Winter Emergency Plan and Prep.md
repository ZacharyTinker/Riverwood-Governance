  - Set seasonal schedules to maintain **68-70°F** when occupied and **65°F** during extended unoccupied periods.  

### 1.2 Water and Pipe Inspections  
- **Inspect Pipe Insulation**  
  - Check insulation on all pipes, especially in areas with boiler system pipes in the ceiling and near exterior walls.  
  - Repair or add insulation where needed to prevent freezing.  

- **Inspect Drop Ceilings**  
  - Confirm that ceiling tiles beneath boiler system pipes are intact and provide proper insulation coverage.

  - Verify portable generators are operational and fully fueled.  
  - Confirm fuel is stored safely and is accessible.  

- **Test Portable Heaters**  
  - Ensure all portable heaters are functioning and ready for deployment.  

- **Inspect Fans and Emergency Supplies**  
  - Confirm fans are operational for use in directing heat to critical areas.  
  - Check inventory of tools for water and gas shutoff, de-icing supplies, flashlights, and batteries.

### 1.4 Building Inspection  
- **Inspect Exterior Walls and Windows**  
  - Check for cracks, gaps, or vulnerabilities in walls and windows.  
  - Repair weatherstripping or caulking to prevent drafts and heat loss.  

- **Inspect Rooftop Units and Vents**  
  - Remove debris from vents and confirm proper drainage.  
  - Verify snow guards and screens are in place to prevent ice accumulation.  

- **Inspect Doors and Entryways**  
  - Ensure doors close securely, and weather seals are intact.

### 1.5 Communication and Training  
- **Review Winter Emergency Plan**  
  - Share the plan with the supporting team and train members on water shutoff, thermostat operation, and emergency procedures.  

- **Test Alerts and Notifications**  
  - Verify functionality of thermostat alerts and internet outage notifications.  
  - Ensure all team members are signed up for DTE Energy notifications.  

- **Update Contact Information**  
  - Confirm current contact details for Rolls Mechanical and all team members.  
  - Store updated information in **Planning Center** and share with the Governing Board.

### 1.6 Snow and Ice Management  
- **Confirm Snow Removal Readiness**  
  - Verify snow removal contractors or volunteers are ready for the season.  
  - Ensure shovels and de-icing supplies are accessible.  

- **Inspect Emergency Lighting and Fire Suppression Systems**  
  - Test emergency lighting systems and replace batteries if necessary.  
  - Confirm sprinklers and other fire suppression systems are operational.
