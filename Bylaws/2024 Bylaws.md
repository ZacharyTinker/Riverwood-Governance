# 2024 Bylaws 
Riverwood Community Church of the Christian and Missionary Alliance

_Revised and Adopted at the January 2024 Annual Meeting_

## Preamble
The New Testament teaches that the local church is the visible organized expression of the body of Christ. It is therefore essentially a spiritual entity and best conceived of as a living, growing organism rather than as an expanding organization. Life is derived from the Head, Jesus Christ, on whom the church is absolutely dependent in order to be and to become all that God has called it to.  

The people of God are to live and serve in obedience to the Word of God and under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. All believers have a vital role to play if the full ministry of the church is to be carried out. Each member of the body must function as directed by Jesus Christ, the Head, and as empowered by His Spirit. This involves ministry: 1) to God (worship), 2) to those within the body of Christ (edification), 3) to those outside the body of Christ (evangelism). Leadership for these on-going ministries is to come from the governance authority, a team chosen from among the local congregation for the godly quality of their lives, as dictated by scripture.  

The local congregation finds broader meaning and outreach in fulfilling its Biblical responsibilities within the life and witness of the denomination. As such, it is an integral part of the district and worldwide fellowship, and is united in governance, fellowship, and service in order to promote unity of faith in the fullness of Jesus Christ as Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and Coming King, and to facilitate the spread of the gospel at home and abroad under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  

Our church mission statement: Our mission is to know Jesus Christ; exalt Him as Savior, Sanctifier, Healer, and coming King; and complete His Great Commission: Evangelizing and discipling persons throughout the United States, and incorporating them in Christ-centered, community-focused congregations, mobilizing them for active involvement in a missionary effort designed to plant Great Commission churches among both unreached and responsive peoples worldwide. Knowing Christ and Completing His Great Commission.

## Article 14 - About the Christian and Missionary Alliance [^14]

### Key Characteristics of the C&MA’s Faith Community and Mission
The Riverwood Community Church of The Christian and Missionary Alliance is a community of faith that exists to exercise and express its biblical beliefs within the broader community of The Christian and Missionary Alliance (C&MA). These beliefs are grounded in a shared understanding of Holy Scripture including those beliefs and standards specifically addressed in the Manual of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. 

#### The C&MA’s Biblical Beliefs
The Riverwood Community Church is a community of faith based on its and the C&MA’s biblical beliefs, which include the Statement of Faith. The C&MA has adopted the statement of faith set forth in the Manual.

#### Representatives and Other Participants
The Riverwood Community Church’s faith community is represented by all of the Riverwood Community Church’s officers, directors, employees, licensed workers and volunteer leaders, each of whom serves the Riverwood Community Church’s mission and is an integral part of the community (each such person is described for purposes of this Statement only as a “Riverwood Community Church representative”). The other community participants, including Riverwood Community Church members and volunteers, contribute to the Riverwood Community Church’s faith community, but they do not represent the Riverwood Community Church unless they are also employees or leaders or have been designated as such by the appropriate ecclesiastical authority. 

#### Christian Exercise and Expression
_**As a Community.**_ The C&MA believes that the local church is the visible organized expression of the Body of Christ and that the local church finds broader meaning and outreach in fulfilling its biblical responsibilities within the life and witness of the denomination. In addition, those who participate in the life of the C&MA, including the Riverwood Community Church representatives, are following the biblical command to live out their faith in community and association with other believers. Accordingly, the Riverwood Community Church is itself an exercise and expression of its biblical beliefs and standards. 

_**Through its Mission Based Activities.**_ The C&MA believes that all Riverwood Community Church activities, including the responsibilities of every Riverwood Community Church member and employee, should be rendered in service to God as a form of worship. Therefore, the Riverwood Community Church as a community of faith exercises and expresses its biblical beliefs in every activity, action, and responsibility. 



### Christian Community Standards for Ministry Activities

#### General Standards
The Riverwood Community Church shall engage in activities and use its facilities solely to exercise and express the biblical beliefs of the Riverwood Community Church and the C&MA and to further the mission of both. In furtherance of this mission, the Riverwood Community Church may provide services or goods to, and may allow use of its facilities by, other groups and persons who are not members or employees of the Riverwood Community Church. But no Riverwood Community Church activity, nor any use of Riverwood Community Church facilities by another group or person, may be conducted or permitted if the Riverwood Community Church determines that such activity or use expresses a message of support by the Riverwood Community Church for any view contrary to the biblical beliefs of the Riverwood Community Church and the C&MA. 

#### Specific Concerns
For many years the C&MA as a faith community has had concerns with the cultural and legal trends in North America. This resulted in specific statements being adopted by the C&MA over the years to biblically address these cultural concerns. These cultural concerns include but are not limited to divorce, marriage, human sexuality, and sanctity of life. The Riverwood Community Church affirms the biblical beliefs and standards expressed in each statement. 

##### Marriage and Human Sexuality
As such, the Riverwood Community Church subscribes to the biblical belief that God creates human beings in His image as two distinct genders, male and female, and that the intended gender identity of an individual is determined by such individual’s biological sex at birth. The Riverwood Community Church applies this belief regarding gender identity in all policies and programs in the Riverwood Community Church’s faith community. In addition, the Riverwood Community Church subscribes to the biblical belief that God has instituted marriage as a covenant relationship between one man and one woman. The Riverwood Community Church recognizes only such marriages for all policies and programs in the Riverwood Community Church’s faith community. Further, the Riverwood Community Church subscribes to the biblical belief that sexual desire is rightfully fulfilled only within marriage and that unmarried singles who abstain from sex can be whole, mature persons, as pleasing to God as persons who are faithful in marriage.

##### Sanctity of Life 
Likewise, the Riverwood Community Church subscribes to the biblical belief that all life is sacred from conception to death and that individuals are known by God from before the foundation of the world and that human life begins at conception and that death is under the sovereignty of God and not man. The Riverwood Community Church accordingly believes that no procedures should be performed for the primary objective of terminating a pregnancy and taking the life of an unborn child (such procedures are referred to herein as abortions) except in rarest of circumstances where other biblical, moral principles prevail, such as where it is medically impossible to save the life of both the mother and the child. Similarly, the Riverwood Community Church believes that no medical procedure should be performed that takes the life of an individual prematurely (such procedures are referred to as euthanasia). The Riverwood Community Church’s beliefs further prohibit paying for or otherwise facilitating such procedures.

As dictated by these beliefs, the Riverwood Community Church as an organization shall not fund abortions in any manner, including through a health care benefit plan that covers prescription drugs that induce abortions, except in the foregoing extraordinary circumstances unless in a particular situation (i) any such drug is prescribed and used solely for a non-abortive therapeutic treatment of a covered medical condition or for an abortion in the foregoing extraordinary circumstances and (ii) coverage is approved by the plan’s governing body or the Riverwood Community Church’s appropriate ecclesiastical authority. In addition, the Riverwood Community Church shall not participate through its health care benefit plan in a program that uses the plan as a means for providing drugs used to induce abortion, except in the foregoing extraordinary circumstances. Any requirement to facilitate abortions or euthanasia by participating in such a program, and any penalty for failing to participate in such a program, would directly and substantially burden and undermine the Riverwood Community Church’s exercise and expression of its biblical beliefs.  

##### Religious Activities
In conformance with these biblical beliefs and standards, the Riverwood Community Church engages solely in activities that further its faith mission. All such activities can and should be vehicles for spiritual growth. Therefore, the Riverwood Community Church considers all of its activities to be a form of religious worship. 

The Riverwood Community Church distinguishes between exclusive religious activities and integrated religious activities. Exclusive religious activities include devotional worship services such as chapel services conducted by the Riverwood Community Church, and distinctly theological education or pastoral counseling. 

Integrated religious activities include activities similar to those conducted by nonreligious organizations for the benefit of society. The Riverwood Community Church conducts such activities in furtherance of and in accordance with its biblical beliefs. 

With respect to restrictions that may be imposed on the use of funds or other benefits offered to the Riverwood Community Church, the Riverwood Community Church shall not agree to any restriction that would preclude the Riverwood Community Church from conducting its integrated religious activities in furtherance of and in accordance with its religious beliefs. The Riverwood Community Church may agree not to use offered funds or benefits for exclusive religious activities. 

#### Implementation
To the extent the Lead Pastor or Board Chair determines it to be necessary or advisable to further the Riverwood Community Church’s mission or to cultivate the Riverwood Community Church’s faith community, he or she may establish additional standards based on Holy Scripture and the beliefs and standards addressed in the Manual for the activities and programs conducted within the faith community or for Riverwood Community Church representatives or other community participants. The determination as to whether any particular activity or use of Riverwood Community Church facilities is not permitted under this Policy requires both spiritual discernment and an understanding of C&MA beliefs and standards which are applied to each particular circumstance. Such determination shall be made in conformance with this discernment and these beliefs and standards in the sole discretion of the spiritual leaders of the Riverwood Community Church designated by the appropriate ecclesiastical authority. With respect to uses by other groups or persons, the Riverwood Community Church may consider without limitation both the content of the proposed activities and whether the group or person is generally perceived by the public as advocating views contrary to the biblical beliefs of the Riverwood Community Church and the C&MA.



### Community Standards for Riverwood Community Church representatives.

#### Roles and Expectations
In response to God’s calling on their lives, Riverwood Community Church representatives exercise and express both their own and the C&MA’s biblical beliefs and standards by working together to advance the Riverwood Community Church’s faith mission. Riverwood Community Church representatives are responsible for defining, cultivating, leading and/or representing the Riverwood Community Church’s faith community as an expression and exercise of their and the C&MA’s biblical beliefs and standards. Accordingly, each Riverwood Community Church representative shall be expected to (i) model these biblical beliefs and standards for others, (ii) perform all of their responsibilities as a service to God and (iii) comply with the following obligations: 

_**Biblical Beliefs.**_ Each Riverwood Community Church representative shall affirm their agreement with the C&MA’s statement of faith and other biblical beliefs and shall not subscribe to or promote any religious beliefs inconsistent with these beliefs. 

_**Christian Conduct Standards.**_ Riverwood Community Church representatives shall at all times (both during working and nonworking hours) endeavor to conduct themselves in a manner that affirms biblical standards of conduct in accordance with theirs and the C&MA’s biblical beliefs. 

_**Distinctly Christian Activities.**_ Each Riverwood Community Church representative shall be ready, willing and able to lead or contribute to distinctly Christian activities such as worship or prayer services. 

#### Noncompliance by Representatives
If any Riverwood Community Church representative does not comply with the obligations set forth above, such representative shall have an obligation to disclose such noncompliance to the Riverwood Community Church. The Riverwood Community Church may determine whether such representative intends or is likely to continue in such noncompliance. If so, then the Riverwood Community Church may dismiss such representative from his or her position on the basis that such representative's noncompliance is inconsistent with and undermines the expression and exercise of the Riverwood Community Church faith community. Such action may be taken in accordance with any applicable procedures in the Uniform Policy on Discipline, Restoration and Appeal. 

#### Volunteers and Contract Workers
Volunteers and contract workers are not considered to be representatives of the Riverwood Community Church’s faith community unless they are serving in leadership positions. Nevertheless, when volunteers and certain contract workers as determined by the Riverwood Community Church, serve with the Riverwood Community Church, they shall be required to acknowledge that they understand and agree to support the Riverwood Community Church’s mission and values. The Riverwood Community Church may give preference for such service to volunteers and contract workers who share its biblical beliefs.
