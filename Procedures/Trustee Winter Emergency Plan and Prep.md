   - Check inventory of tools for water and gas shutoff, de-icing supplies, flashlights, and batteries.

### 1.4 Building Inspection  
1. **Inspect Exterior Walls and Windows:**  
   - Check for cracks, gaps, or vulnerabilities in walls and windows.  
   - Repair weatherstripping or caulking to prevent drafts and heat loss.  

2. **Inspect Rooftop Units and Vents:**
