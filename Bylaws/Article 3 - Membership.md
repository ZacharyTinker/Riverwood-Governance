## Reference to A5 Article III 

- Application for Membership
  - All applicants desiring membership shall meet with the Elder Board or at least two representatives of such. Upon approval of the Elder Board, they shall be recommended for acceptance as members. Applicants shall be received into membership in a regular public service following their recommendation from the Elder Board. 

- Transfer of Membership
  - Upon written request from another Christian body/fellowship/church, an individual's membership in this Christian and Missionary Alliance church may be transferred to the requesting church. No verbal requests will be accepted. Upon action by the Elder Board, suggestions or comments may be included in the transfer of membership to the receiving church (Ephesians 1:22-23; 2:21-22; 3:14-15; 4:4)
 
- Inactive Members
  - Members who do not attend services for any of the following reasons may be placed on the inactive list and shall be automatically reinstated upon their return:
    - Students attending college or school away from home
    - Those engaged in full time Christian service, as pastors, evangelists, missionaries, etc.
    - Those in military service.
    - The aged, infirmed, or those residing in institutions or rest homes.
  - Members who are willfully absent from church services for an extended period may be placed on the inactive list by recommendation of the Elder Board. A letter stating such action shall be sent. This action shall always carry with it the loss of privilege to vote in church meetings and to hold office in the church. Inactive members shall be contacted by a representative of the Elder Board each year before the Annual meeting to determine their desire regarding membership. If contact cannot be made, the member shall be removed and notified by a member of the Elder Board. 

- Discipline
  - The goal of ANY action of discipline is the full, complete and loving RESTORATION of the person who may have sinned or erred.
